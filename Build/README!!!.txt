														    Welcome

															
This game is called TicTacToe Or "X and 0".The one we play on a Hashtag shaped grid :P.

A few instructions to use the program:-

1)The Game has two modes :
			a)Player Vs Computer:This is coded in such a way that its VERY difficult to WIN against the computer. 
								It uses a special search algorithm to predict all the possible moves for every move 
								and with every step chooses the one with maximum chances of success or in worst case 
								it will draw the game.
								Gotta admit, thats pretty cool.
								I still challenge you guys to play fair and win it. Ill treat u if u do. 
								*cocky smile*
								
			b)Player1 Vs Player2: Here two players can enter their names and play against each other. Simple.
			
2)Whenever you have finished reading a screen you can press ENTER to go to the next screen.
			Also press ENTER after typing a choice or your name.
			In Multi-player mode press Enter after choice.
			This actually doesn't need to be said.You'll get it when you run it the program once.
			
3)Please DONT enter ANYTHING other than what is asked.
			ESPECIALLY in the "Player Vs Computer" mode: 
								Don't enter wrong options or Place markers where there is already one.
			The serial numbers of the chosen option is to be entered.
			ELSE the program will just hang or print crazy stuff.
			Everywhere else I have tried to idiot-proof the game. :P
		
4)The game play is self- explanatory. If you don't know the game, I pity you.
