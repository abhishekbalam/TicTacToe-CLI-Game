# Unbeatable TicTacToe CLI game in C++.

## Introduction
**Tic-tac-toe**  (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

My first project , experimenting with C++ and C. Started making this game for fun in the boring Structured Programming lectures. :P
This was the first time I learned to think in a programming language and implementing an algorithm. All the code is written in a structural manner.

## Features

* Completely Command Line Based With ASCII Art Splash Screens.
* All Controls From keyboard.
* Windows executable included. 
* The Game Has Two Modes
    * **Player Vs Player** 
        Here two players can enter their names and play against each other. Simple.
    * **Player Vs Computer**
        This is coded in such a way that its very difficult to *WIN* against the computer. 
        It uses a special algorithm (MINIMAX Algorithm) to predict all the possible moves for every move 
		and with every step chooses the one with maximum chances of success or in worst case 
		it will *DRAW* the game.

# Install

* Run this Code::Blocks project in your respective OS. Binary for Windows included in `/Build` folder.
* For more details read the [wiki](https://github.com/abhishekbalam/Unbeatable-TicTacToe-CLI-Game/wiki) .

# Play Instructions

* Whenever you have finished reading a screen, or made a choice, or given an input you can press ENTER to go to the next screen or to submit the values.

* Please DONT enter ANYTHING other than what is asked.
    * Especially in the "Player Vs Computer" mode:
        Don't enter wrong options or Place markers where there is already one.
        The serial numbers of the chosen option is to be entered else the program will just hang or print crazy stuff.
        Everywhere else I have tried to idiot-proof the game.

* The game play is self- explanatory.

Thanks alot for taking ur time to read this and to test this game. Please tell me if there's anything to improve. I will be more than glad to accept suggestions.
